# MODEL_LIMITATIONS.md — Cortex Atlas

## Purpose

This document describes the known limitations of Cortex Atlas.

Cortex Atlas is designed to analyze **written communication behavior**.  
It does not claim to model people, minds, intent, or outcomes.

Understanding these limitations is required for responsible use.

---

## Scope Limitations

Cortex Atlas analyzes:
- How information is structured in writing
- How communication patterns repeat
- How transitions between communication modes occur

Cortex Atlas does **not** analyze:
- Internal mental states
- Emotions or sentiment
- Motivation or intent
- Beliefs, values, or ideology
- Intelligence, competence, or character

---

## Input Limitations

Results depend on the quality and quantity of input text.

Cortex Atlas performs poorly when:
- Input text is extremely sparse
- Content is heavily templated or boilerplate
- Multiple authors are mixed without separation
- Text is highly performative or intentionally deceptive
- Context necessary for interpretation is missing

When these conditions are detected, confidence indicators are reduced or outputs may be withheld.

---

## Interpretation Limitations

All interpretations are:
- Probabilistic
- Context-dependent
- Based on observable patterns only

Cortex Atlas cannot:
- Explain *why* someone communicates a certain way
- Predict future behavior outside the analyzed corpus
- Determine correctness, effectiveness, or quality of communication
- Resolve disagreements about meaning or intent

Interpretations should be treated as **descriptive lenses**, not conclusions.

---

## Model Limitations

Cortex Atlas relies on:
- Statistical feature extraction
- Clustering heuristics
- Probabilistic automata inference
- LLM-assisted summarization

As a result:
- Different model versions may produce different structures
- Small changes in input can affect inferred state boundaries
- Some inferred states may overlap or remain ambiguous

No single output should be treated as definitive.

---

## Bias & Generalization

Cortex Atlas may reflect biases present in:
- Training corpora
- Domain-specific writing conventions
- Language norms

The system does not claim universality across:
- Cultures
- Languages
- Disciplines
- Power dynamics

Users should exercise caution when applying outputs outside their original context.

---

## Misuse Risks

Cortex Atlas should not be used:
- As an evaluative or disciplinary tool
- For hiring, firing, or ranking individuals
- As a proxy for psychological assessment
- To assert authority over another person’s communication

Such uses fall outside supported scope and invalidate results.

---

## Human Judgment Required

Cortex Atlas is designed to support human understanding, not replace it.

Outputs should be:
- Reviewed critically
- Compared against lived experience
- Discussed collaboratively when used in teams

If an output feels misleading, it likely reflects a limitation rather than a hidden truth.

---

## Final Note

Cortex Atlas models patterns in communication — nothing more.

It offers **structure**, not certainty.

Any use that assumes otherwise exceeds the system’s design.
