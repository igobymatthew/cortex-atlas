# Inference Pipeline

1. Ingest documents and normalize text.
2. Chunk text into analysis units.
3. Extract structural features and embed them.
4. Cluster feature embeddings into communication patterns.
5. Infer automata states and transitions from cluster sequences.
6. Generate interpretations, confidence, and non-claims.
