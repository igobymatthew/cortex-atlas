Cortex Atlas - Matthew Ballard - 2025


# **1. CORE CONCEPT**

**Cortex Atlas** = an AI system that ingests a person’s written communication (emails, tickets, chats, documentation) and produces a **formalized cognitive operating model** of how that person interprets information, makes decisions, and miscommunicates.

It’s NOT “personality analysis.”
It’s **thinking-style translation tech.**

# **2. MVP SCOPE (STRICT)**

### **Inputs**

* 5–200 text samples per person.
* Sources: uploaded docs, pasted text, Gmail/Slack integration (OAuth), Jira tickets.

### **Outputs**

A **Cognitive Operating Sheet** with the following components:

1. **Information Structure Profile**

   * Prefers bottom-up vs. top-down reasoning
   * Implicit assumptions they always make
   * How they chunk information
   * Compression level (over-detailed, under-detailed, etc.)

2. **Decision Grammar**

   * IF/THEN patterns
   * Common state transitions (e.g., *uncertainty → overexplaining*, *pressure → shortcutting*)

3. **Ambiguity Model**

   * Tolerance level
   * What types of ambiguity cause breakdowns
   * How they resolve missing details

4. **Interpretation Biases**

   * Risk-seeking vs risk-averse
   * Error modes (e.g., “misreads urgency,” “interprets suggestions as requirements,” etc.)

5. **Translation Guide**

   * *How YOU must speak to THEM for signal clarity.*
   * Sentence templates
   * “Don’t do this” list
   * “They misunderstand X as Y” mapping

6. **Team Map (MVP+)**

   * Overlay 2–20 people
   * Visual mismatch heatmap
   * Team failure-mode prediction

### **Non-Features (MVP Exclusions)**

* No predictive psychology
* No video/audio ingestion
* No sentiment scoring
* No therapy/medical positioning
* No real-time Slack bot (v2)

---

# **3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE**

### **Frontend**

* Next.js + Tailwind (fast, clean)
* OAuth setup (Gmail, Slack, Notion optional)
* Secure file/text upload
* Dynamic “Cognitive Map” renderer (D3.js or Recharts)

### **Backend**

* FastAPI (Python) or Node/Typescript
* Auth: Supabase Auth or Clerk
* User/project storage: Postgres
* File storage: S3-compatible (e.g., Cloudflare R2)

### **AI Layer**

**Primary Components:**

1. **Embedding Engine**

   * Sentence-transformers (e.g., bge-large-en or similar)
   * Vector DB (Weaviate / Pinecone / Qdrant)

2. **LLM Interpretation Layer**

   * Mistral 7B (fine-tuned) or GPT-4.1 for early inference
   * Converts clusters → cognitive profile

3. **Automata Approximation Engine**

   * Model to infer state transitions:

     * Extracts repeated structures
     * Identifies decision triggers
     * Outputs a pseudo-state-machine
   * Techniques:

     * Finite-state induction from sequence patterns
     * Probabilistic automata (Alergia algorithm or GramGAN variant)
     * Hard rule-mining à la RIPPER

4. **Translation Engine**

   * LLM generates “To communicate with this person, do X” constraints
   * Severity grading on mismatch zones

# **4. DATA PIPELINE**

### **1. Collection**

* OAuth connectors or manual upload
* HTML/text extraction
* Normalization (strip signatures, boilerplate)

### **2. Segmentation**

* Split into semantic units (thought blocks)
* Remove filler and non-decisions

### **3. Structural Feature Extraction**

Each text chunk gets features for:

* Entropy
* Logical operator frequency
* Hedging/commitment patterns
* Ordering preference
* Abstraction level
* Topic drift

### **4. Clustering**

Group by cognitive consistency:

* “Planning mode”
* “Explaining mode”
* “Task decomposition mode”
* “Boundary-setting mode,” etc.

### **5. Automata Inference**

* Extract transitions between modes
* Build state machine representing thought flow
* Derive internal grammar (what triggers state jumps)

### **6. LLM Interpretation**

* Convert automata + stats → readable cognitive sheet
* Identify failure modes
* Produce communication “translation keys”

### **7. Delivery**

* Render as interactive map
* Export PDF (HR, managers, coaches)

---

# **5. MODELING STRATEGY**

### **Base Models**

* Mistral 7B (local fine-tune: LoRA) → interpretable reasoning layer
* bge-large-en embedding model for clustering

### **Fine-Tuning Data**

Synthetic + real:

* Thousands of “communication pattern → profile” examples
* You can generate synthetic corpora of different thinking styles (engineer, PM, frantic founder, autistic communicator, ADHD communicator, etc.)

### **Automata Induction**

* Use Alergia to extract a deterministic probabilistic automaton from text sequences
* Simplify into human-readable states
* Map triggers directly to communication behaviors

### **Differentiator**

This isn’t vibes.
This is **formal inference + interpretive LLM.**

# **6. USER FLOWS**

### **Onboarding**

1. User creates org
2. Uploads text samples (or integrates Slack/Gmail)
3. Sets “analysis target” (self or teammate)

### **Ingestion**

* Progress bar
* “Sample quality” report

### **Output**

* Cognitive Operating Sheet
* State Machine Visualization
* “How to Write for This Person” cheat-sheet
* Communication Recipes:

  * “If you need alignment, use format X”
  * “If you want them to catch nuance, phrase it as Y”

### **Retention Loop**

* Users run recurring analyses over time
* Compare “thinking drift”
* Track communication improvements
* Team compatibility map unlocks for orgs

# **9. COMPETITION MAP**

**Closest neighbors (but not actual competitors):**

* CrystalKnows → personality typing
* Receptive.io → team communication patterns
* Grammarly → writing quality

**None infer cognitive structure from text.**

Your differentiator:

# **13. RISK ANALYSIS (REAL, NOT FLUFF)**

### **1. “Pseudoscience” Perception**

Mitigation: emphasize **behavioral patterns**, not personality.

### **2. Data Privacy**

Mitigation: zero-retention processing; on-prem compute for enterprise.

### **3. Overtrust in AI Interpretation**

Mitigation: show raw data → show reasoning → show uncertainty.

### **4. HR misuse**

Mitigation: don’t position as hiring/firing tool.

### **5. Hard Problem: Automata Inference**

Mitigation: hybrid statistical + LLM interpretation; don’t overspecify states.
